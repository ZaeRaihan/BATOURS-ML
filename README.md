BATOURS Recommendation Systems

We built Recommendation Systems for BATOURS app using Collaborative Filtering method to gives personalized recommendation for users. We use dataset from Kaggle, the Indonesia Tourism Destination datasets.
There are 3 files in this repository, which are:
1. BATOURS Folder that includes datasets used by the model
2. ipynb Python Notebook
3. py Python file

For everyone who wants to run the model, this is how to run the model:
1.	Download the “BATOURS” folder and upload it to your Google Drive
2.	Download the .ipynb files
3.	Open Google Colaboratory dan open the .ipynb file from step 2.
4.	Run all the cells from the Python Notebook

Unfortunately, we faced some difficulties, such as deploying the model to cloud or to android. Some of the reasons include the following:
1.	Lack of learning materials for deploying recommendation systems to cloud or mobile.
2.	Our team did not have time to implement the rating feature in the application so that the machine learning model could not run.
